    <title>Gyutto Games Pitch</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Gyutto Games is a mobile gaming platform where your customers buy tokens from you to play short multiplayer games with chances to win your menu items as prizes. Basically, selling access to our platform, like selling lottery tickets.</p>
<p><strong>How you make money:</strong> you buy tokens from us upfront at wholesale, sell them at retail for guaranteed profit. The system automatically caps your prize costs at (for example) 50% of token profits, so you can never lose money on prizes. Break-even is around 10 token sales per day.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Your staff prints access codes on your receipt printer like gift cards. Customers scan table tents, play 5-minute games on their phones. <b>Game winners</b> stand a chance to become <b>prize winners</b>, and prize winners get notified instantly about their menu prizes (Instagram/Facebook). The games are branded and customized for your venue but carry Gyutto branding, so technical issues and customer complaints come to us, not you.</p>
<p>Setup is R6800 for custom branding and table tents, then R650 monthly. You buy token inventory upfront but can top-up anytime through your dashboard. You control prize types, values, and win rates.</p>
<p>We handle all game development, technical maintenance and customer support. Your only operational requirement is selling tokens and honoring the prizes you configure. We're essentially providing you a new revenue stream where customers pay extra for entertainment while they're already at your venue.</p>
